			<td class="text"> I got this weight on my shoulder it's slowing me down
I don't know how it came about
And while the world is spinnin' faster every night
I feel I'm stuck in reverse somehow

But it ain't no one's fault that I am stuck here
No one to blame this on, feeling so hopeless
I keep on pouring salt on my wounds when I shouldn't stay

I feel the pressure on me
How it's itching under my own skin
It's getting real hard to breathe
I gotta move on, gotta move on right now

I feel the pressure

A force of habit to point out another mistake
But two wrongs don't make one right
I gotta pull it together bеfore it's too late
An hourglass in my mind a lie

I know it's all my fault that I am stuck hеre
No one to blame this on, feeling so hopeless
I gotta find the way before it disappears
I cannot stay

I feel the pressure on me
How it's itching under my own skin
It's getting real hard to breathe
I gotta move on, gotta move on right now

I feel the pressure

Ooooooh
When did I get so blind?
I didn't see this coming
Ooooooh
I should've heard faith calling...
Trying to pull me out
But how do I get out?
Yeah how do I get out?

I feel the pressure on me
How it's itching under my own skin
It's getting real hard to breathe
I gotta move on, gotta move on right now

I feel the pressure</td>
